#Convolutional Neural Networks for Accurate Skin Cancer Diagnosis
Skin cancer is a prevalent type of malignancy in humans, and its diagnosis involves a visual examination and further medical procedures such as dermoscopy, biopsy, and histopathological analysis. However, the classification of skin lesions using automated image analysis is a complex task due to the wide range of variations in the appearance of skin lesions.

Dataset used is the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :

Melanocytic nevi
Melanoma
Benign keratosis-like lesions
Basal cell carcinoma
Actinic keratoses
Vascular lesions
Dermatofibroma
